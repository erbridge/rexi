[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/erbridge/rexi.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

> A front-end for [Xi Editor](https://github.com/google/xi-editor), built with
> React and Electron.

**WIP**

## Getting Started

First make sure you have a working version of
[xi-editor](https://github.com/google/xi-editor) built somewhere on your system,
following the build instructions in its repository.

Then set the path to the `xi-core` binary as `XI_CORE_BIN` and run `yarn start`:

```
$ XI_CORE_BIN=/path/to/xi-editor/rust/target/debug/xi-core yarn start
```
